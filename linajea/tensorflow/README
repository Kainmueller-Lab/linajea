README: Tensorflow module

This is a deprecated module, having been replaced by
funlib.learn.tensorflow. Setups older than setup10 
used the linajea.tensorflow U-Net in their mknet.py,
and setup10 and more recent use funlib.learn.tensorflow. 

Other users who have modeled their setups after older
setups are encouraged to switch to the funlib U-Net
used in setup10+.
