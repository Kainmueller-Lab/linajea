README:

To create the singularity container, you must copy the gurobi tar file used to install the gurobi software into this directory.
The tar file can be downloaded from: http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/download-center.
The version tested is gurobi8.1.0-linux64.tar.gz - if you use a different version, you should update the Singularity file accordingly.
