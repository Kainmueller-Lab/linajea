README: Linajea

This is the main software repository for the linajea cell tracking project. 
Includes tools and infrastructure for running a pipeline that starts
from light sheet data and ends in extracted cell lineage tracks.
The linajea_experiments repository contains example scripts, network setups,
and data folders, and is the location where you will actually
run training and inference scripts. This library contains all the supporting
code to run those experiments, and is where most of the interesting
functionality resides, other than network architecture definition.


VERSIONING
After and initial period for experimentation with high change in the code base,
we are releasing version 1.0. After that release, the master branch will remain
stable, and all improvements will be made on a dev branch. Minor version updates
will include minor bugfixes and added functionality, while major version updates
will be reserved for changes that break backwards compatibility.

We also have a series of singularity containers which we started formally versioning
well before the repo as a whole, and thus the container versions were already at 1.5.14
by the time we created version 1.0 of the code. It makes sense to now align the versions
of the singularity containers with the versions of the code, so I will be changing the 
old containers to start with 0 (eg 0.5.4 instead of 1.5.4) and then start from 1.0.


CONTRIBUTING
If you make any improvements to the software, please create a new branch named
descriptively for the feature you are upgrading or bug you are fixing, commit
your changes to that branch, and create a pull request asking for my (cmalinmayor)
permission to merge. Help is always appreciated!

Many of the modules in this project have their own README to provide more information.
