README: Linajea

This is the main software repository for the linajea cell tracking project.
Includes tools and infrastructure for running a pipeline that starts from light
sheet data and ends in extracted cell lineage tracks.  The linajea_experiments
repository (https://github.com/funkelab/linajea_experiments) contains example
scripts, network setups, and data folders, and is the location to
actually run training and inference scripts. This library contains all the
supporting code to run those experiments, and is where most of the interesting
functionality resides, other than network architecture definition.


VERSIONING
The current stable version is v1.3, and the 1.4-dev branch has the
most cutting edge functionality. We will do our best to release minor version
updates with bugfixes and added functionality, while major
version updates will be reserved for changes that break backwards
compatibility.


CONTRIBUTING
If you make any improvements to the software, please fork, create a new branch named
descriptively for the feature you are upgrading or bug you are fixing, commit
your changes to that branch, and create a pull request asking for 
permission to merge. Help is always appreciated!
